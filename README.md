# HelloTask - Task Management Application

## Description
This project is a web application designed for task management. 
The core idea for the complete application is to cater to beginner developers attempting to manage their tasks when working on solo projects.
With the current version, a user can create an account and then add and manage their tasks. 

## Key feature
A key aspect of the application is motivational support. 
For this purpose, HelloTask incorporates the assignment of tokens with each task created. 
These tokens can be assigned based on perceived task difficulty or desirability.
The user can set a token goal to achieve within a week and then the assigned tokens add up towards this goal as tasks are completed.
In this manner, a reward-like system is established that serves to motivate users towards completing their tasks.
